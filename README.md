 📘 Notebook Details

01. Data Preprocessing in Machine Learning  
File: 
`01_Data_Preprocessing_in_Machine_Learning.ipynb`

Concepts Covered:**
- Creating DataFrames using Pandas
- Identifying missing (null) values
- Dropping rows with missing data
- Filling missing values using mean imputation
- Calculating percentage of missing data
- Encoding categorical variables
  - Label Encoding
  - One-Hot Encoding

This notebook demonstrates how raw data is cleaned and prepared before applying any machine learning algorithm.



02. Feature Scaling in Machine Learning  
File:  
`02_Feature_Scaling_in_Machine_Learning.ipynb`

Concepts Covered:**
- Importance of feature scaling
- Standardization using StandardScaler
  - Mean = 0, Standard Deviation = 1
- Normalization using MinMaxScaler
- Comparing scaled and original values
- Splitting data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`

This notebook explains how feature scaling helps machine learning models perform better.



03. Supervised Learning: Linear Regression  
**File:  
`03_Supervised_Learning_Linear_Regression.ipynb`

Concepts Covered:**
- Introduction to supervised machine learning
- Linear Regression theory
- Understanding the equation:  
  y = mx + b
- Training a Linear Regression model
- Predicting output based on input data
- Practical example: Predicting marks based on study hours

This notebook demonstrates how a supervised learning model is trained and used for prediction.
